# Vault take home interview task

## Prerequisites

You should use Node.js v22.14.0. Tests do not pass in Node.js v20 and below due to an issue with the latest version of MSW (Mock Service Worker).

```bash
# If you have nvm, this will read .nvmrc and make sure you are all set:
nvm use
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Running the tests

```bash
npm run test
```
